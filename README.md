# Bank-Plan-Saving-Application
This project was made a while ago (1 year ago) where I used a GUI (Java FX) to create an application for the user to store types of stocks to the system. It uses a variety of data structures to store the data, buttons, as well as giving you the option to save your data. Just remember to have the entire folder, might not work otherwise :)
